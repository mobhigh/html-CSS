Note about section and div
The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. 
An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. 
For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.
